1. Select your **connected device**
    - E.g. Windows, Chrome, Emulator
2. Run **'void main() {...}'** with either:
    1. Default Methods:
        - Ctrl + F5 (Will run the default `main.dart`)
        - Top-left -> `Run` -> `Without Debugging`
    2. For specific project samples
        1. Locate any **'void main() {...}'**
            - Mostly located in main.dart files
        2. Above `void main...`, click `Run | Debug | Profile`
